[ ] GR

##GR

- Anyone need a calculator?  
- Tear off equation sheet on the back of the GR.  

###General Advice
- Show your work! Helps me give you partial credit.  
- Don't forget engineering notation and units!
- Focus on the problems first! Don't get bogged down by the T/F and MC.

###GR-Specific
- Go through GR page-by-page, pointing out errata.  
    Problem 4 - the words at the top of the problem read "In the below circuit,
the 120 Ohm resistors..."  
    Should read "12 Ohm Resistors"
