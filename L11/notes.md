##GR

- Anyone need a calculator?  
- Tear off equation sheet on the back of the GR.  

###GR-Specific
- Go through GR page-by-page, pointing out errata. 

    Problem 2 - I want V2(t) - just A*cos(360*f*t)V  
    Problem 4 - the words at the top of the problem read "In the below circuit,
    the 120 Ohm resistors..."  
    Should read "12 Ohm Resistors"  
    B/C - I2 should be Arms  

###General Advice
- Show your work! Helps me give you partial credit.
- Don't forget engineering notation and units!
- Focus on the problems first! Don't get bogged down by the T/F and MC.
- Don't leave problems blank.  Pace yourself.
- Write down what you know.
